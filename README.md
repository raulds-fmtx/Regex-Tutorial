# An Intro to Regeular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and validation in strings. In this tutorial, we'll break down a regex that validates email addresses to understand how each part functions.

### What is a Regex?

A regular expression, commonly known as regex, is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. This search pattern can be used for various purposes in computer science, including:

1. **Search Operations**: Finding specific patterns within a text. For example, finding all email addresses in a document.
2. **Text Replacement**: Replacing parts of a string that match a pattern with a new string. For example, replacing all instances of "foo" with "bar".
3. **Input Validation**: Validating if input data meets certain criteria. For example, checking if a user's input matches the format of a valid email address.
4. **Text Parsing**: Extracting specific information from text. For example, parsing log files to extract timestamps or error messages.
5. **Syntax Highlighting**: In text editors and IDEs, regex is used to identify keywords and other elements of programming languages to apply syntax highlighting.

Regex is widely used in various programming languages, text editors, and tools for its efficiency in handling text-based operations.

### How is a Regex Structured?

A regex is composed of various components, each serving a specific purpose to define a search pattern's criteria. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the common components:

1. **Literals**: Match the exact characters in the pattern. For example, `cat` matches the substring "cat" in the text.
2. **Metacharacters**: Characters with special meanings, such as `.` (any character), `^` (start of string), `$` (end of string), etc.
3. **Character Classes**: Defined within square brackets `[ ]`, they match any one character from the set. For example, `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter.
4. **Quantifiers**: Specify the number of times an element should be matched. Common quantifiers include `*` (0 or more), `+` (1 or more), `?` (0 or 1), and `{n,m}` (between n and m times).
5. **Anchors**: Assert a position in the string. For example, `^` asserts the position at the start of the string and `$` at the end.
6. **Groups and Capturing**: Parentheses `( )` group parts of a pattern together and capture them for back-references. Non-capturing groups use `(?: )`.
7. **Alternation**: The pipe `|` acts as a logical OR to match one pattern or another.
8. **Escapes**: Use a backslash `\` to escape metacharacters and match them literally.

Understanding these components and how they interact is key to mastering regex.

## Summary

We'll be dissecting the following regex to understand its components and how it ensures that a string is a valid email address:

```regex
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```

This regex ensures that an email address has the correct structure, including a local part, an "@" symbol, a domain name, and a top-level domain (TLD).
